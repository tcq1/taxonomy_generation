This is the code that was used in the thesis 'Generating Taxonomy from large Text Corpora using Machine Learning'.
This directory contains the folders output, resources and src. The output directory is used as a place to save
training data in files in order to access them later to save time. It also contains the final model that is used in
the user interface. And finally it contains the plots that were used in the thesis.
The resources directory contains all documents that were used as the material testing text corpus.
The src directory contains all the code. In the src directory there is another readme file going further into detail.

notes.txt contains some notes that were made during the whole process of coding and evaluation. It is not really of
importance.
